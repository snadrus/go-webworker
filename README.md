## Go WebWorker

Ever want to run something, but it's in JS (no problem) and it needs WASM in a DOM/WebWorker context? (uh-oh)
This is a great way to run lots of things from other languages that get nicely packed-up into WebWorker libraries. 

WIP: Initially it will be "just enough webworker" to run the Emscripten-compiled version of Verovio, which has poor OS portability. 
All contributions are welcome.
